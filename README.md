# Automated Parking System (APS)

<ins>**Problem Statement:**</ins>

Design a comprehensive software solution for efficiently managing automated
parking garages, addressing the challenges of limited urban parking space. The
system should incorporate intelligent parking space allocation, seamless
payment processing, user-friendly interfaces, and robust security measures to
ensure smooth vehicle entry and exit. Additionally, the solution should offer
features like automated vehicle retrieval, reservation capabilities, and real-time
notifications to enhance user convenience and overall parking experience.
The aim of this project is to design and implement an automated parking
garage system that efficiently manages vehicles entering and exiting the
garage. The system will use advanced technologies to automate the entire
parking process, providing a seamless experience for both vehicle owners and
the garage management.
